    /**
     * Adds a new file descriptor to be polled by the looper.
     * If the same file descriptor was previously added, it is replaced.
     *
     * "fd" is the file descriptor to be added.
     * "ident" is an identifier for this event, which is returned from pollOnce().
     * The identifier must be >= 0, or ALOOPER_POLL_CALLBACK if providing a non-NULL callback.
     * "events" are the poll events to wake up on.  Typically this is ALOOPER_EVENT_INPUT.
     * "callback" is the function to call when there is an event on the file descriptor.
     * "data" is a private data pointer to supply to the callback.
     *
     * There are two main uses of this function:
     *
     * (1) If "callback" is non-NULL, then this function will be called when there is
     * data on the file descriptor.  It should execute any events it has pending,
     * appropriately reading from the file descriptor.  The 'ident' is ignored in this case.
     *
     * (2) If "callback" is NULL, the 'ident' will be returned by ALooper_pollOnce
     * when its file descriptor has data available, requiring the caller to take
     * care of processing it.
     *
     * Returns 1 if the file descriptor was added, 0 if the arguments were invalid.
     *
     * This method can be called on any thread.
     * This method may block briefly if it needs to wake the poll.
     *
     * The callback may either be specified as a bare function pointer or as a smart
     * pointer callback object.  The smart pointer should be preferred because it is
     * easier to avoid races when the callback is removed from a different thread.
     * See removeFd() for details.

     * already be running or for it to run one last time if the file descriptor was already
     * signalled.  Calling code is responsible for ensuring that this case is safely handled.
     * For example, if the callback takes care of removing itself during its own execution either
     * by returning 0 or by calling this method, then it can be guaranteed to not be invoked
     * again at any later time unless registered anew.
