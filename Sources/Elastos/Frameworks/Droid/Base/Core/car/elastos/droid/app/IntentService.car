     * IntentService is a base class for {@link Service}s that handle asynchronous
     * requests (expressed as {@link Intent}s) on demand.  Clients send requests
     * through {@link android.content.Context#startService(Intent)} calls; the
     * service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker
     * thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.
     *
     * <p>This "work queue processor" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks
     * from an application's main thread.  The IntentService class exists to
     * simplify this pattern and take care of the mechanics.  To use it, extend
     * IntentService and implement {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)}.  IntentService
     * will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as
     * appropriate.
     *
     * <p>All requests are handled on a single worker thread -- they may take as
     * long as necessary (and will not block the application's main loop), but
     * only one request will be processed at a time.
     *
