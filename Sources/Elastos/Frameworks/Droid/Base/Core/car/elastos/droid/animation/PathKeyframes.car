     * PathKeyframes relies on approximating the Path as a series of line segments.
     * The line segments are recursively divided until there is less than 1/2 pixel error
     * between the lines and the curve. Each point of the line segment is converted
     * to a Keyframe and a linear interpolation between Keyframes creates a good approximation
     * of the curve.
     * <p>
     * PathKeyframes is optimized to reduce the number of objects created when there are
     * many keyframes for a curve.

     * Typically, the returned type is a PointF, but the individual components can be extracted
     * as either an IntKeyframes or FloatKeyframes.
