     * This class contains window animation frame statistics. For example, a window
     * animation is usually performed when the application is transitioning from one
     * activity to another. The frame statistics are a snapshot for the time interval
     * from {@link #getStartTimeNano()} to {@link #getEndTimeNano()}.
     * <p>
     * The key idea is that in order to provide a smooth user experience the system should
     * run window animations at a specific time interval obtained by calling {@link
     * #getRefreshPeriodNano()}. If the system does not render a frame every refresh
     * period the user will see irregular window transitions. The time when the frame was
     * actually presented on the display by calling {@link #getFramePresentedTimeNano(int)}.
