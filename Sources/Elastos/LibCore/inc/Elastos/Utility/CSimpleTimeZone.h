     * Constructs a {@code SimpleTimeZone} with the given base time zone offset from GMT,
     * time zone ID, and times to start and end the daylight savings time. Timezone IDs can
     * be obtained from {@code TimeZone.getAvailableIDs}. Normally you should use
     * {@code TimeZone.getDefault} to create a {@code TimeZone}. For a time zone that does not
     * use daylight saving time, do not use this constructor; instead you should
     * use {@code SimpleTimeZone(rawOffset, ID)}.
     * <p>
     * By default, this constructor specifies day-of-week-in-month rules. That
     * is, if the {@code startDay} is 1, and the {@code startDayOfWeek} is {@code SUNDAY}, then this
     * indicates the first Sunday in the {@code startMonth}. A {@code startDay} of -1 likewise
     * indicates the last Sunday. However, by using negative or zero values for
     * certain parameters, other types of rules can be specified.
     * <p>
     * Day of month: To specify an exact day of the month, such as March 1, set
     * {@code startDayOfWeek} to zero.
     * <p>
     * Day of week after day of month: To specify the first day of the week
     * occurring on or after an exact day of the month, make the day of the week
     * negative. For example, if {@code startDay} is 5 and {@code startDayOfWeek} is {@code -MONDAY},
     * this indicates the first Monday on or after the 5th day of the
     * {@code startMonth}.
     * <p>
     * Day of week before day of month: To specify the last day of the week
     * occurring on or before an exact day of the month, make the day of the
     * week and the day of the month negative. For example, if {@code startDay} is {@code -21}
     * and {@code startDayOfWeek} is {@code -WEDNESDAY}, this indicates the last Wednesday on or
     * before the 21st of the {@code startMonth}.
     * <p>
     * The above examples refer to the {@code startMonth}, {@code startDay}, and {@code startDayOfWeek};
     * the same applies for the {@code endMonth}, {@code endDay}, and {@code endDayOfWeek}.
