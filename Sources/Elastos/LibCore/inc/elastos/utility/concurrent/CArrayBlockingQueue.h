    /**
     * Shared data between iterators and their queue, allowing queue
     * modifications to update iterators when elements are removed.
     *
     * This adds a lot of complexity for the sake of correctly
     * handling some uncommon operations, but the combination of
     * circular-arrays and supporting interior removes (i.e., those
     * not at head) would cause iterators to sometimes lose their
     * places and/or (re)report elements they shouldn't.  To avoid
     * this, when a queue has one or more iterators, it keeps iterator
     * state consistent by:
     *
     * (1) keeping track of the number of "cycles", that is, the
     *     number of times takeIndex has wrapped around to 0.
     * (2) notifying all iterators via the callback removedAt whenever
     *     an interior element is removed (and thus other elements may
     *     be shifted).
     *
     * These suffice to eliminate iterator inconsistencies, but
     * unfortunately add the secondary responsibility of maintaining
     * the list of iterators.  We track all active iterators in a
     * simple linked list (accessed only when the queue's lock is
     * held) of weak references to Itr.  The list is cleaned up using
     * 3 different mechanisms:
     *
     * (1) Whenever a new iterator is created, do some O(1) checking for
     *     stale list elements.
     *
     * (2) Whenever takeIndex wraps around to 0, check for iterators
     *     that have been unused for more than one wrap-around cycle.
     *
     * (3) Whenever the queue becomes empty, all iterators are notified
     *     and this entire data structure is discarded.
     *
     * So in addition to the removedAt callback that is necessary for
     * correctness, iterators have the shutdown and takeIndexWrapped
     * callbacks that help remove stale iterators from the list.
     *
     * Whenever a list element is examined, it is expunged if either
     * the GC has determined that the iterator is discarded, or if the
     * iterator reports that it is "detached" (does not need any
     * further state updates).  Overhead is maximal when takeIndex
     * never advances, iterators are discarded before they are
     * exhausted, and all removals are interior removes, in which case
     * all stale iterators are discovered by the GC.  But even in this
     * case we don't increase the amortized complexity.
     *
     * Care must be taken to keep list sweeping methods from
     * reentrantly invoking another such method, causing subtle
     * corruption bugs.
