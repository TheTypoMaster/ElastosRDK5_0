    /**
     * An unbounded {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} that uses
     * the same ordering rules as class {@link PriorityQueue} and supplies
     * blocking retrieval operations.  While this queue is logically
     * unbounded, attempted additions may fail due to resource exhaustion
     * (causing {@code OutOfMemoryError}). This class does not permit
     * {@code null} elements.  A priority queue relying on {@linkplain
     * Comparable natural ordering} also does not permit insertion of
     * non-comparable objects (doing so results in
     * {@code ClassCastException}).
     *
     * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
     * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
     * Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
     * #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
     * the PriorityBlockingQueue in any particular order. If you need
     * ordered traversal, consider using
     * {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.  Also, method {@code drainTo}
     * can be used to <em>remove</em> some or all elements in priority
     * order and place them in another collection.
     *
     * <p>Operations on this class make no guarantees about the ordering
     * of elements with equal priority. If you need to enforce an
     * ordering, you can define custom classes or comparators that use a
     * secondary key to break ties in primary priority values.  For
     * example, here is a class that applies first-in-first-out
     * tie-breaking to comparable elements. To use it, you would insert a
     * {@code new FIFOEntry(anEntry)} instead of a plain entry object.
     *
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class FIFOEntry<E extends Comparable<? super E>>
     *     implements Comparable<FIFOEntry<E>> {
     *   static final AtomicLong seq = new AtomicLong(0);
     *   final long seqNum;
     *   final E entry;
     *   public FIFOEntry(E entry) {
     *     seqNum = seq.getAndIncrement();
     *     this.entry = entry;
     *   }
     *   public E getEntry() { return entry; }
     *   public int compareTo(FIFOEntry<E> other) {
     *     int res = entry.compareTo(other.entry);
     *     if (res == 0 && other.entry != this.entry)
     *       res = (seqNum < other.seqNum ? -1 : 1);
     *     return res;
     *   }
