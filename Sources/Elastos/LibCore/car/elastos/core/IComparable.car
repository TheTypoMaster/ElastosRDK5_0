     * {@code y.compareTo(z) < 0}, then {@code x.compareTo(z) < 0} must hold) and
     * invertible (the sign of the result of x.compareTo(y) must be equal to the
     * negation of the sign of the result of y.compareTo(x) for all combinations of
     * x and y).
     * <p>
     * In addition, it is recommended (but not required) that if and only if the
